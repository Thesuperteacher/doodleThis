#project overview 
You are building a web app where users can draw/ doodle. that doodle needs to be recognized by the app. and then compare it with another image.
something like rock, paper, scissors but that can go indefinitely. 

# Doodle Duel: Step-by-Step Roadmap

## 1. Project Planning & Design
- **Define Game Concept:**
  - Dynamic challenge: Each round, the previous doodle becomes the prompt.
  - Creative doodling with AI recognition and explanation.
- **Feature List:**
  - Drawing interface with HTML5 canvas.
  - Real-time doodle recognition using TensorFlow.js.
  - Smart logic engine for evaluating matchups.
  - Explanation generator for outcomes.
  - Community features (user contributions, leaderboards).

  
- **Tech Stack Decision:**
  - **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Canvas API, react-canvas-draw, Socket.io-client.
  - **Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript, NestJS, Socket.io, PostgreSQL, Redis (for caching).
  - **Database:** MongoDB.
  - **Deployment:** Docker, Vercel (frontend), Railway.app/DigitalOcean (backend), GitHub Actions (CI/CD).

## 2. UI/UX Design
- **Wireframes & Mockups:**
  - Landing page, drawing canvas, gameplay flow screens, and result/explanation modals.
- **User Flow:**
  - **Start Screen:** Introduce the challenge (e.g., "Draw something that beats a rock").
  - **Drawing Interface:** Tools for sketching (pen, eraser, clear).
  - **Submission & Evaluation:** Submit drawing, AI recognizes doodle, logic engine compares.
  - **Result Screen:** Display outcome with an explanation.
- **Prototyping:**
  - Build interactive prototypes using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

## 3. Frontend Development
### 3.1 Project Setup
- Initialize project repository with Git.
- Set up package manager (npm/yarn) and install necessary libraries:
  ```bash
  # Initialize new project
  npm init -y   # or: yarn init -y

  # Core dependencies (specific versions for compatibility)
  npm install next@12.3.4 react@17.0.2 react-dom@17.0.2
  npm install @types/react @types/react-dom typescript
  
  # Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies (specific versions)
  npm install -D tailwindcss@3.3.0 postcss@8.4.21 autoprefixer@10.4.14
  
  # Drawing related (with legacy peer deps flag)
  npm install react-canvas-draw@1.2.1 @types/react-canvas-draw --legacy-peer-deps
  npm install fabric.js
  
  # AI/ML dependencies  
  npm install @tensorflow/tfjs@3.21.0
  npm install @tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder@1.3.3 --legacy-peer-deps
  
  # State management & utilities
  npm install zustand@4.3.8 axios socket.io-client
  
  # Development dependencies
  npm install -D eslint prettier
  npm install -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
  ```

- Initialize TypeScript and TailwindCSS:
  ```bash
  # TypeScript setup
  npx tsc --init
  
  # TailwindCSS setup (after installing dependencies)
  npx tailwindcss init -p
  ```

### 3.2 Develop the Drawing Interface
- **Canvas Implementation:**
  - Integrate HTML5 `<canvas>` for drawing.
  - Implement basic drawing tools (pen, eraser, clear button).
- **User Experience:**
  - Ensure a responsive design for both desktop and mobile.
  - Add intuitive UI/UX elements for smooth interaction.

### 3.3 AI Integration for Doodle Recognition
- **TensorFlow.js Integration:**
  - Load a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., based on the Quick, Draw! dataset).
  - Process the canvas image data and obtain real-time predictions.
- **Display Feedback:**
  - Show recognized object and confidence score to the user.

### 3.4 Build Gameplay & Explanation UI
- Develop components for:
  - Game prompts and dynamic challenge transitions.
  - Result display with explanation text (e.g., "Water extinguishes fire").
  - Navigation between rounds.

## 4. Backend Development
### 4.1 Server Setup
- **Node.js & Express:**
  - Create a lightweight server to manage game sessions and endpoints.
- **WebSocket Integration:**
  - Implement Socket.io for real-time communication (updates, turn management).

### 4.2 Game Logic & State Management
- Develop a logic engine to:
  - Compare doodles based on the knowledge base of object interactions.
  - Determine winning conditions.
  - Generate explanations for outcomes.
- **Database Schema:**
  - Design MongoDB schemas for user sessions, game states, and community contributions.

## 5. AI and Explanation Engine
- **Doodle Evaluation:**
  - Integrate the CNN model with the game logic.
  - Develop routines that map recognized doodles to logical outcomes.
- **Explanation Module:**
  - Build a system (or integrate a rule-based engine) that references a curated knowledge base.
  - Generate concise, educational explanations for each round's result.

## 6. Community & Engagement Features
- **User Authentication:**
  - Implement login/signup functionality for personalized experiences.
- **User-Generated Content:**
  - Allow players to propose new objects and define their interactions.
- **Competitive Features:**
  - Develop leaderboards and achievement systems.
  - Enable social sharing of game results and doodle chains.

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit & Integration Testing:**
  - Write tests for both frontend components and backend endpoints.
- **User Testing:**
  - Conduct beta tests with target users to gather feedback.
- **Performance Testing:**
  - Optimize real-time AI processing and WebSocket communication.

## 8. Deployment & DevOps
- **Containerization:**
  - Use Docker to containerize the application for consistency.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):**
  - Set up pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Hosting:**
  - Deploy the backend on cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or GCP.
  - Host the frontend on services like Netlify or Vercel.

## 9. Post-Deployment & Iteration
- **Monitor & Analyze:**
  - Use analytics and user feedback to monitor performance and engagement.
- **Iterative Improvements:**
  - Roll out updates to fix bugs, improve AI accuracy, and add new features.
- **Community Engagement:**
  - Continuously integrate community contributions to expand the game universe.
